# Chrome Extension MELON Prototype
This is a prototype of my final work. It includes a chrome extension and a dashboard page, as well as a Python API.
The extension sends the HTML to the API and receives a response that includes the information on that page as well as the result given to it by an AI.
This data is then saved to a database.
On the dashboard, you can see this data and you can change your settings.
