# Mongo Restify Prototype
One of my very first prototypes, back when I still thought I would have a Javascript Back-end. This is my version of the assignment 'prototype backend rest servive' as described in our course, using MongoDB and Restify.
Features are listed in public/index.html, which can also be seen by going to localhost:8000/index. The form on this page saves to a mongodb database.

## How to start the prototype
1. run `npm install`
2. Run `node index.js`
3. Go to localhost:8000/index
