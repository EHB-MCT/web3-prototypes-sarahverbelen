# AI API Prototype
This is my first prototype that uses AI. Originally I wanted to have something that used Javascript in the back-end; I used two different AI API's and wanted to combine their results to have something a bit more reliable. However, after an AI infosession with the AI knowledge centre of my school, I decided to change it up a little and I started using Python to train my own AI model, using a Dutch dataset. Additionally, this prototype has a small React front-end you can use to interact with my final API. 

## How to start the Prototype
1. run `npm install`
2. To start the back-end javascript: `node index.js`
3. To start the back-end python: `python pythonapi.py` 
4. To start the front-end: navigate to the ai-frontend folder and run `npm start`
