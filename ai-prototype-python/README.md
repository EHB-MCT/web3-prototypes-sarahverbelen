# Ai Prototype Python
This was the prototype where I decided I would use Python for the back-end because of the AI. This was about halfway through the AI-API Prototype. In this prototype, I mainly followed a Pluralsight tutorial and experimented a bit myself with the AI.

## How to start the prototype
1. run `python sentiment.py`

You will see the results of the training outputted into the terminal.
