## Overview of the Prototypes
Each prototype has its own Readme with more information, as well as instructions to start them.

* **AI-API-Prototype:**

This is my first prototype that uses AI. Originally I wanted to have something that used Javascript in the back-end; I used two different AI API's and wanted to combine their results to have something a bit more reliable. However, after an AI infosession with the AI knowledge centre of my school, I decided to change it up a little and I started using Python to train my own AI model, using a Dutch dataset. Additionally, this prototype has a small React front-end you can use to interact with my final API. 

* **AI-Prototype-Python:**

This was the prototype where I decided I would use Python for the back-end because of the AI. This was about halfway through the AI-API Prototype. In this prototype, I mainly followed a Pluralsight tutorial and experimented a bit myself with the AI.

* **Hapi-Prototype:**

One of my very first prototypes, back when I still thought I would have a Javascript Back-end. This is my version of the assignment 'prototype backend rest servive' as described in our cursus, using Hapi.  

* **Mongo-Restify-Prototype:**

One of my very first prototypes, back when I still thought I would have a Javascript Back-end. This is my version of the assignment 'prototype backend rest servive' as described in our cursus, using MongoDB and Restify.

* **Plugin-Full-Prototype:**

My last and most important prototype. I would've liked to have integrated every technology I would use in my Final Work. However, I mainly integrated a Chrome Extension with a Python API. The API receives the HTML from the extension, scrapes it (using BeautifulSoup) and uses AI to perform a sentiment analysis on this data. 

* **Plugin-Prototype-Test:**

A prototype of a Chrome Extension based on the Getting Started Tutorial from the Chrome Extension Docs. 
Plugin-Prototype
A chrome extension that scrapes r/worldnews and saves the titles, the karma and the user that posted the post into a MongoDB database. 

* **Plugin-React-Prototype:**

This is the front-end part of Plugin-Prototype. It's a React app that requests data from the API from the previous prototype and displays it in a neat list, using components. 

* **Python-Plugin-Prototype:**

This was the prototype where I tried to research how I could combine a chrome extension (which only works with Javascript) and a Python back-end. Among other things, I tried to compile Python code into Javascript by using 'Rapydscript', although this turned out to create more problems then it solved. In the end, I decided to work with a Python API that could be called from the Javascript of the chrome extension.

* **React-Prototype:**

My very first React Prototype. My version of the assignment 'prototype frontend' as described in our cursus.
